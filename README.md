# Pipe Puzzle
In this term project, We implemented a game by using JavaFX framework. This game aims moving a ball from a start point to an end point if there is an appropriate path. The user is supposed to form a path using pipes given as sliding tiles.
___
### Some Properties:

There will be several levels; the user will not be able to play next level without completing a previous one.  
Level aspects will be constructed according to the input files.  
The ball will start from the blue tile and the path will end at the red tile. (Start and end tiles’ positions may be different for each level.)(Since the visuality is optional, we changed this design by using applications such as photoshop.)  
The blue and red tiles cannot move.   
The user will use mouse to move the tiles.  
Grey tiles indicate movement free spaces.  
Tiles can move only if the desired position is movement free.  
The tiles can move 1 tile distance, vertically and horizontally.  
Tiles cannot move diagonally.  
Number of moves must be recorded and printed to the screen.  
While you are constructing the game board, you may use images for each tile.  

Note: Since the visuality is optional, we changed this design by using applications such as photoshop.
